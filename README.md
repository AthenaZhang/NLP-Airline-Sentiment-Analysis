# NLP-Airline-Sentiment-Analysis
## Objective 
To understand factors that impact passenger satisfaction before/during/after COVID-19, then create models to predict customer sentiment, so we may help airlines to identify and improve their unsatisfied services. 

## Dataset 
We obtained dataset using Selenium - web scraping from Skytrax.com. 

## Approach
We performed EDA to analyze the data, then did sentiment analysis using Textblob and Word Cloud. We compared 3 different algorithm (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and Random Forest) and also build an LDA model to identify the most discussed topics.
