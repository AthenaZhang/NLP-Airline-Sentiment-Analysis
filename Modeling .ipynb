First flight was cancelled on the 19th of May and then again on the 20th once we flew to our layover in Chicago. Then they gave us invalid meal and hotel vouchers at the customer service desk in Chicago. We didn't find out until we took the shuttle to the hotel, so we had to find a place to stay. Our flight they got us on wasn't even to our original destination. They also took our bags when we didn't want them checked due to an overbooked flight. Also we tried the online service and calling which both were terrible and no help. This was supposed to be our honeymoon and now it doesn't exist because of terrible service. Never fly united. We lost double of what the ticket cost.\""

       "['my direct flight from san francisco to singapore was cancelled and the service which followed from united airlines can only be described as diabolical. firstly we were informed by the pilot whist sitting on the plane that he was \"just about to take the break off the plane when someone on the ground noticed a fuel leak\". what sort of safety measures is this company taking pre take off if someone only noticed a flight leak this late in the game? we sat on the plane for another hour waiting for the fuel leak to be investigated and eventually we were sent back to the airport. by this time it was 1am. we lined up waiting to speak to united staff to obtain more information however the queues were barely moving. by 2am i decided to get my hold luggage and leave. we were told the incorrect information 3 times by united officials with regards to where to collect our bags. i eventually asked a cleaner who kindly took me to the right place. we were also told to collect hotel vouchers from the united attendants at the baggage hall however they denied all knowledge of this and sent us back upstairs. it was a complete shambles. 3am and i eventually lost my temper having already taken 3 flights to get to san francisco. i was eventually given a hotel voucher. the next day i checked the united app to see whether there was advice with regards to how to refund the flight cost. i discovered that united had booked me on a flight from san francisco to frankfurt to singapore and they had not communicated this to me via email, text or in person. i cancelled the flight and was offered a refund for the original flight cost. i agreed to this and then an error stating the refund could not be processed popped up. i booked another flight with singapore air when the united flight was cancelled, and arrived at the airport 2 days after my original flight to discuss my flight refund with united staff in person. i waited for an hour at the united counter whilst employees tried to figure out if they could refund me (one would think this is a regular occurrence). eventually they told me i have to do it online (even though sometimes they can do it person) as well as claim for all the food i ate while i was stuck in san francisco and the difference between my original united flight ticket cost and the new singapore airlines ticket price (more expensive because of demand and short notice). i claimed online and was told i would not be reimbursed for any of the food costs incurred, or the taxi from airport to the airport hotel, or the difference between the united airlines flight and the singapore air flight. united gave me a refund for the cancelled flight and a united airlines voucher (which i will clearly never use!) i asked for cash refund instead, they said they \"don\\'t do this\". the service from united was absolutely dreadful. i do not know how any company operates like this but i will never fly united again. this delay has resulted in a multitude of extra costs for me at my next destination including a covid test which is now 4 times more expensive than my original booking, money lost on a hotel, money to change my onward flight from my next destination. not to mention how the stress has affected me emotionally.',\n",
       " 'cancelled flight to auckland 2 months before travel. called to find alternatives. dates required to stay same as trip has been pre planned. alternative offered for outbound flight no problem. no same class alternative for return. i inquired about any seat available in any class as trip is family reunion after covid and specific dates are needed. it was suggested that i was only interested in upgrade as i “was asking to change flight”. what? i don’t want to change anything, i want the flight you sold me but cancelled. i need to travel on this specific date. you have cancelled my flight, if you can get me on a plane you should. don’t fly united.',\n",
       " \"columbus to bangalore via newark & frankfurt. never fly united! it's hands down the worst airline in the us and their customer service and complaint resolution official (cro) are a joke! in our case united assigned a cro who had been of zero help and keeps trying to wash their hands off all responsibility that an airline carrier has! we encountered issues in both onward and return international journeys with united. we chose to purchase expensive return tickets with reduced travel time so my family could travel comfortably. blr to cmh original travel time was scheduled to be ~24 hours, due to cancellations and delays from united the actual time turned out to be ~40 hours! during the return journey, cmh to blr which was again scheduled to be ~24 hours, again due to cancellations and delays from united this turned out to be ~48 hours! there were two passengers traveling and one was 70 years old and had accessibility needs and united had confirmed wheelchair. due to reroute they were redirected to sfo and there was no one available to push the wheelchair and another passenger was made to push the wheelchair! due to all these delays, covid tests expired and we had to re-do covid test at newark airport which costed us another $250. united hasn't reimbursed us to date. they misplaced our baggage which didn't reach cmh for another 3 days. not only did they not deliver the luggage and we had to go all the way to cmh airport to collect it but they damaged it.\",\n",
       " \"fort myers to san jose. i flew with united airlines about 4 times in 2022. i had the worst experience ever. the flight attendant terrorized me about wearing the mask. she brought a paper with a warning on it and she put my name down. she said that i have to wear a double mask! i tried to sleep during this 10-hour flight but couldn't because of the way they were treating me. the flight attendant put the flashlight in my face to see if the mask was worn correctly. the food was so bad, i could hardly eat. then, the flight attendant kept telling me that i have to keep my mask between each bite. the service was extremely poor. the seats are so tight, there's no leg room at all. the wifi didn't work at all during the whole length of the flight. i don't want to travel on this airline again.\",\n",
       " 'united airlines is such an awful airline. it is 100 percent guaranteed to have a delay or cancellation at some point in your trip. i have taken 8 flights with them in the last 6mo with 100 percent of them either delayed or cancelled leaving me and hundreds of other people stranded. they also also keep playing these loud sales messages for credit cards and these long covid messages. at least 15 total minutes of these blaring obnoxious messages. i am terrified now when united is the only airline that has what i need. i notoriously wait till the last second to buy my flights but the prospect of having to fly united ever again in the future is enough to make me plan ahead.',\n",
       " \"bad from the start. as soon as my mother and i checked our bags the agent told us there was an issue with the flight. i asked her what she meant and she told me that there was a delay, but we would still make our connecting flight. which i feel she knew quite well that we would not. there was an hour delay, then the boarding process took forever, people from later groups cutting in front of the current group, it took forever to leave the runway, then we had to wait to land until there was a gate available, we kept circling the airport. by the time we landed in newark, nj our flight had already departed. there was no one at our gate to help us, we had to search the airport to find customer service. there was a long line once we reached it, with only 2 agents available. it was painfully slow. they kept telling us to use the qr code and/ or the kiosk, but we needed to speak with someone so continued to wait. a woman cut in front of the entire line and the female agent helped her anyway. the line was frustrated and angry and a man went up and told the agent that the woman had cut in front of everyone and that it wasn't fair and she needed to wait in line like everyone else. she continued to help her anyways, then left and went to go get another agent and they both continued to help this woman and make the rest of us wait. it was at least another 20 minutes of them helping her as though she was more important than the rest of us. it was unfair and frustrating to us all. we were in line for an hour or so before we finally made it to the front of the line. hours later saw the same woman who had cut in front of the line sitting at her gate so obviously she wasn't in dire need of immediate help. 6 hours later we finally were able to get a flight. all of this could have been avoided if the agent who had checked our bags had found us an alternate flight instead of putting us on a plane that more than likely wasn't going to make it in time for our connecting flight. i will not fly united airlines again. i had a very similar terrible experience when it was just continental airlines about 10 years ago. my small children and i ended up having to spend the night in newark at the airport. it was a nightmare! apparently although they had merged with united it's still just as lousy the two airlines being combined. back then they didn't have covid or staff shortage as an excuse.\",\n",
       " 'absolutely terrible experience. on the flight from kc to chicago, we were told to switch planes after boarding due to the flight crew not having an adequate first aid kit. although this wasn’t a huge deal and i understand mistakes happen, the delay caused myself and my coworkers to be late to our business meeting, which made us look terrible to the clients we were meeting. on the flight home from chicago to kc is where the real issue was. i was seated wearing a mask, as the rules require, when i was approached by an incredibly rude flight attendant. from the way i was sitting she couldn’t tell that i had a mask on, so when she approached me she realized i did have one on. however out of her own pride, or some other reason that i can’t figure out, she went ahead and yelled at me in front of my boss, saying if she sees me without my mask on again she will “report me.” my coworkers and i sat dumbfounded because her yelling at me and causing this scene made absolutely no sense because i was doing nothing wrong. the flight delay due to the first aid kit ordeal wasn’t a huge issue, and as i stated mistakes happen. but the flight attendant being incredibly rude to me for no reason is unacceptable. i will never fly with united again, nor will my coworkers and boss that witnessed this. we work for a large company of over 5,000 employees and we will be sure to spread the word to the rest of the company to never fly with united again while on our business travels.',\n",
       " 'united is getting worse every time i fly. the planes are always dirty, seats are too small and people are crammed in like sardines with their knees in their stomachs, if you drop something there is no way to retrieve it until after the plane lands because conditions are so cramped and flight attendants are constantly ill mannered and rude. i booked through a third party and ended up with united only coming home. they did not tell me i would be charged to bring my luggage home until flight check in, the other airline did not charge for any of my bags. this racket is not acceptable. i was not forced to pay or abandon my luggage at the last possible moment. then when we landed my luggage was filthy dirty and had foot prints on it. now i know why i have broken items every time i fly united. they will not honor my accumulated miles. apparently i do not meet the acceptable conditions, not sure what the miles are for if i can never redeem them. i am incentivized to gain these points that i cannot use when i try. same with the flight vouchers for delayed and cancelled flights. i tried to use my last voucher and was denied over and over until it finally expired during covid. i called to request an extension and was denied. finally to the female flight attendant on the flight from orlando to denver on january 19th, do not run into my children with your beverage cart. my kids were asleep and due to the minuscule size of the seats their legs had dipped into the aisle. first they were shoved aside, then run into with the beverage cart. the last time my three year old was run into the female flight attendant hit her so hard as she walked past that she actually pushed the baby off the seat. my children should not have been touched in the first place let alone harmed multiple times as they attempted to sleep through the flight. life is hard right now for everyone, there is no reason to make it worse.',\n",

       " 'i was excited to take my first transatlantic flight for over 18 months. a few weeks ago i traveled in united\\'s polaris class from sfo to london (lhr) with two other members of my family. when booking the flights, the booking agents confirmed i would be in the new polaris product with the suites. the outbound flight used united\\'s old business class cabin which hadn\\'t changed layout and seats (with the exception of some nice amenities). on the return flight, the plane had the new polaris cabin which was great. united flies the 787-9 on this route. many of these aircraft have not been updated to the new polaris cabin. you can check if you are on the new product by looking at the seat map. if the cabin has four seats across you are in the new polaris cabin. if there are six seats, you have the old business class product. both ways the service was great from the flight attendants, though there was no personalized greeting once the flight was underway (an easy fix). the food was the worst i have seen across 20+ years of traveling in business class especially when spending almost $9000 in tickets. as an example, on the way back for the pre arrival meal, they served what was called \"hamburger wellington\" a dry hamburger with processed cheese and some kind of bread or pastry around it (see picture). dinner was disappointing. i chose the beef which was over cooked and bore little similarity to what was described on the menu. desert was a small tub of ice cream. the cabin staff who served seemed embarrassed and apologetic when i brought up the food quality suggesting cost cuts and covid. there was no other food served during the flight between the 2 main meals so we went hungry. in summary, if you fly out of the us internationally and your equipment is a 797-9, you may not fly in the new cabin with the suites. it seems like the booking agents are unaware of the difference between the two business class products and you may be told you are flying in the new suites when you are not. at least i flew one way in the new product, but only because the equipment was changed at the last minute. when i booked the flight, it was a priority for me to travel both ways in the new product. if food is important to you as part of your flying experience, i would definitely advise looking at other carriers. if it\\'s not a priority, i would advise bringing your own food or eating beforehand. in terms of alternatives to the uk from sfo take a look at british airways and virgin. you won\\'t regret it. i did contact united about the food in particular (the ceo and his executive assistant) to get feedback from the company and left my phone number. after a few weeks i was sent what looked like an email based on a standard template which did not specifically address my concerns.',\n",

(she later remarked that since i called her a ‘stewardess’ i do not fly very often. despite the fact i’m in the air every month. she really went out of her way to be insulting.) i repeated the fact that i donʼt want to sit in any exit rows and i want my second child also moved away from the exit row. i repeated that i believed that itʼs faa regulations that we must agree to sit there and agree to assist or be moved and would they please move us. at this point the stewardess started to get very aggravated and said ‘we offered you a seat in the back‘ and you didnʼt take it and subsequently switched me again from row 7c to 8c. she rolled her eyes an also stated that ‘here we go again, acting demeaning and rude. i didnʼt ‘buyʼ a seat that means they can put me wherever, even in an exit row- apparently even without my consent. i would like to add here that i very much liked to have bought assigned seats; however the first opportunity i got in the entire purchase / check-in process was two hours before boarding when all the seats for sitting together already were taken. in summary my 13 year old was placed into row 12e and my 15 year old was in an exit row 20 the entire flight although he was a minor and i did not agree for him to sit there. finally in the last 30 minutes i approached the staff again to re-seat us. furthermore security measures ask for parents to assist children during a flight with oxygen masks as well as ensure that seatbelts are worn between and after bathroom breaks. how can a parent assure that this happens properly when the parent is placed on the opposite side of the airplane with isles blocked by carts and other people? in my case this was not as big of a deal as my children are teenagers but there was another group of passengers where the parent was split from a 6 year old child and the child was expected to basically fly on their own? she was crying and was not allowed to be seated next to her parent.',\n",

       " 'i was excited to take my first transatlantic flight for over 18 months. a few weeks ago i traveled in united\\'s polaris class from sfo to london (lhr) with two other members of my family. when booking the flights, the booking agents confirmed i would be in the new polaris product with the suites. the outbound flight used united\\'s old business class cabin which hadn\\'t changed layout and seats (with the exception of some nice amenities). on the return flight, the plane had the new polaris cabin which was great. united flies the 787-9 on this route. many of these aircraft have not been updated to the new polaris cabin. you can check if you are on the new product by looking at the seat map. if the cabin has four seats across you are in the new polaris cabin. if there are six seats, you have the old business class product. both ways the service was great from the flight attendants, though there was no personalized greeting once the flight was underway (an easy fix). the food was the worst i have seen across 20+ years of traveling in business class especially when spending almost $9000 in tickets. as an example, on the way back for the pre arrival meal, they served what was called \"hamburger wellington\" a dry hamburger with processed cheese and some kind of bread or pastry around it (see picture). dinner was disappointing. i chose the beef which was over cooked and bore little similarity to what was described on the menu. desert was a small tub of ice cream. the cabin staff who served seemed embarrassed and apologetic when i brought up the food quality suggesting cost cuts and covid. there was no other food served during the flight between the 2 main meals so we went hungry. in summary, if you fly out of the us internationally and your equipment is a 797-9, you may not fly in the new cabin with the suites. it seems like the booking agents are unaware of the difference between the two business class products and you may be told you are flying in the new suites when you are not. at least i flew one way in the new product, but only because the equipment was changed at the last minute. when i booked the flight, it was a priority for me to travel both ways in the new product. if food is important to you as part of your flying experience, i would definitely advise looking at other carriers. if it\\'s not a priority, i would advise bringing your own food or eating beforehand. in terms of alternatives to the uk from sfo take a look at british airways and virgin. you won\\'t regret it. i did contact united about the food in particular (the ceo and his executive assistant) to get feedback from the company and left my phone number. after a few weeks i was sent what looked like an email based on a standard template which did not specifically address my concerns.',\n",

       " \"if i ever have another choice, i will choose a different airline. for this particular trip, our flights were booked through swiss air, but our first flight of the day was operated by united. united does not have curbside check-in, and we are moving to another country for 2 years, so we have the maximum allowed baggage (2 carry on and 2 checked under 32 kg -- based on swiss air's rules). the guy at the counter told us we had to have a negative test result before we could get a boarding pass but the location of the xprescheck (where we scheduled to get our tests) is in the terminal, so you have to have a boarding pass to enter. he finally decided it was okay to use our vaccination cards. our bag was two pounds over. he said it would be $400 per bag that was over. we repacked to make sure each bag was under weight. your flight was delayed twice, so you're going to miss your connection in chicago, even though you had a three hour layover. we'll rebook your flights for you. the only flight he could find was the next day with 2 of us in business class and three of us in economy for the first leg of the flight (basically any portion operated by united). but they don't offer to refund the difference between the price we paid for everyone to have business class nor do they offer any kind of assistance (like a hotel stay since it was their fault or even a free meal service)? nothing. it's just our bad luck that we flew with united. went back to a hotel to wait for tomorrow's flight. took a one hour covid test at a new location so we could check in online, but we still can't because even with the negative results uploaded in their system, they won't let us check in without looking at our passports. so i have three little kids that i can't check seats to make sure they are sitting somewhere near me and i can't check in online to let them know how much baggage we have. i took the exact same trip through delta a month ago and it was entirely smooth sailing. if they have to reschedule your flight, they take the time to pick seats out with you immediately to make sure you are sitting near your children. but with united, we rely on the kindness of other passengers to trade seats with us so that we can sit with our kids. if you want a trouble free flight domestically or internationally, with service personnel who go the extra mile to help you out when they have failed in any part of their performance, you don't want united.\",\n",

       " \"i've previously written about four negative experiences that i had in a row flying on swa. i still had a small travel voucher that i didn't want to go to waste, so i decided to use it. my experience was average, i suppose. while i've also written generally glowing reviews about slc airport, the swa check-in staff at swa were blasé. not rude, not mean, but also not remotely interested-acting or helpful. just robotic. i even get more helpful service on united (relatively speaking, and that says something). same for the swa gate staff. as for flight staff, the flight attendants were a mix of very cheery and upbeat (almost scarily so), or yeah, blasé and even kind of bossy to and barking orders at passengers. not very helpful. at least the fa i had to interact with for the most part was the cheery and upbeat one. once at houston hobby, it took almost 30 minutes to retrieve checked baggage from the carousel, while this may be more of a hobby airport personnel problem, this is a problem that southwest needs to address with airport management, as the airport is an airline hub. on the bright side, the plane was almost spanking new and very clean. the snack and coke served were delicious. the plane was only about half occupied, though i don't know whether that has to do with bookings and demand, or with the fact that we're still in a pandemic. social distancing was possible and enforced, as a result. overall summary: at least this flight experience on swa was average rather than hostile, so i guess that's an improvement for this airline. i still wouldn't recommend, as it will take many more average or above-average flights with them to convince me that they're not actually the worst airline in the usa (and i'm far more willing to fly on delta or alaska normally anyway for domestic flights).\",\n",

       " \"alaska seems to have lost a little quality, going from very good/excellent to good/very good. not a huge slip in quality, but still noticeable when my prior experiences flying on alaska have been excellent. the check-in agents in houston were grumpy and discourteous, not only did not exchange pleasantries with passengers, they just weren't pleasant. on the flight from houston bush to seattle-tacoma, the jet was dirty and looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a couple of days. i say it was the second or third dirtiest jet i've ever flown on. the catering in houston had dropped the ball on some meals that passengers had ordered, including mine, but the crew offered for me to have another available meal that cost the same, which i accepted - and which was tasty. the crew were polite, focused and professional, but not very friendly. just robotic. they weren't rude, but they seemed kind of intense, which is something i didn't expect from alaska. i also purchased in-flight wifi, which turned out to be slow, it didn't stream the videos i wanted and didn't let me even go a simple google search. i'm still not happy about that. now, the flight from seattle-tacoma to portland was better, quicker boarding, much nicer and cleaner plane, much more cheerful and appreciative flight attendants. so, for now, i will continue to fly them when i can and be a mileage plus member for the foreseeable future, but alaska may sadly have lost a slight bit of its way during a pandemic which has required them to reduce service and cut costs otherwise, and it's really a shame. even so, as of now, i'd still rather fly with alaska than american, southwest, or any us budget carrier.\",\n",

       " 'on monday morning (05/03/21) i checked my baggage in at spokane international airport. delta air lines (asa) accepted my checked baggage and tsa screened and accepted my baggage for airline transportation. one of these items was a box of factory sealed ammunition that weighed approximately 25 pounds. my baggage was transferred to another asa airplane in seattle and transported to juneau where i had a three hour layover after which i would board another asa flight to my final destination in sitka. during the boarding process in sitka, i was called to the asa customer service desk in the departure lounge. once at the customer service desk a rather rude customer service agent informed me that my ammunition would not be allowed to travel to sitka. when i asked why, she stated that the box (baggage) \"had the wrong markings on it\". when i inquired as to what the wrong markings were, she couldn\\'t give me an answer, stating only that an airline baggage handler had said that the markings were wrong. i then assured her that i was well aware of faa, tsa, and asa regulations regarding the transportation of ammunition and that my baggage met all of those requirements. about that time she started to become very rude and, with a raised voice, informed me that my baggage didn\\'t meet the requirements. i then asked her to explain to me how it was that both the tsa agents and the asa customer service agents in spokane cleared my ammunition for transportation on asa earlier the same day. she defiantly stated that the people in spokane were wrong. following that comment, she stated that i needed to pull my face mask up over my nose, which had slipped down during our conversation. since the municipality of juneau owns the airport, it really wasn\\'t her place to try and assert authority over my mask. when questioned further, she stated that i was welcome to exit security, repackage my ammunition and then check it in again for transportation with asa. i stated that since the flight was already boarding and there was only one flight a day to my residence, that was not a feasible option. after i boarded the plane i placed a call to someone in juneau to attempt to pick up my ammunition so at least the asa baggage handler wouldn\\'t get to keep it. the most logical conclusion i can come to is that someone at asa in juneau wanted my ammunition and timed the notification to me that it wouldn\\'t be allowed on the flight so that i wouldn\\'t have time to deal with retrieving it. it would be nice if alaska air would compensate me for my troubles and $1,000 loss but i won\\'t hold my breath. if they don\\'t i will go out of my way to give my business to small regional airlines and other major airlines, even if they cost more!',\n",

       " 'on monday morning (05/03/21) i checked my baggage in at spokane international airport. alaska airlines (asa) accepted my checked baggage and tsa screened and accepted my baggage for airline transportation. one of these items was a box of factory sealed ammunition that weighed approximately 25 pounds. my baggage was transferred to another asa airplane in seattle and transported to juneau where i had a three hour layover after which i would board another asa flight to my final destination in sitka. during the boarding process in sitka, i was called to the asa customer service desk in the departure lounge. once at the customer service desk a rather rude customer service agent informed me that my ammunition would not be allowed to travel to sitka. when i asked why, she stated that the box (baggage) \"had the wrong markings on it\". when i inquired as to what the wrong markings were, she couldn\\'t give me an answer, stating only that an airline baggage handler had said that the markings were wrong. i then assured her that i was well aware of faa, tsa, and asa regulations regarding the transportation of ammunition and that my baggage met all of those requirements. about that time she started to become very rude and, with a raised voice, informed me that my baggage didn\\'t meet the requirements. i then asked her to explain to me how it was that both the tsa agents and the asa customer service agents in spokane cleared my ammunition for transportation on asa earlier the same day. she defiantly stated that the people in spokane were wrong. following that comment, she stated that i needed to pull my face mask up over my nose, which had slipped down during our conversation. since the municipality of juneau owns the airport, it really wasn\\'t her place to try and assert authority over my mask. when questioned further, she stated that i was welcome to exit security, repackage my ammunition and then check it in again for transportation with asa. i stated that since the flight was already boarding and there was only one flight a day to my residence, that was not a feasible option. after i boarded the plane i placed a call to someone in juneau to attempt to pick up my ammunition so at least the asa baggage handler wouldn\\'t get to keep it. the most logical conclusion i can come to is that someone at asa in juneau wanted my ammunition and timed the notification to me that it wouldn\\'t be allowed on the flight so that i wouldn\\'t have time to deal with retrieving it. it would be nice if alaska air would compensate me for my troubles and $1,000 loss but i won\\'t hold my breath. if they don\\'t i will go out of my way to give my business to small regional airlines and other major airlines, even if they cost more!',\n",

(sorry, american. a cookie and four ounces of water in a plastic bag is not \"food and drink service\".) american airlines is not running an airline; they are running a casino, and their customers are betting they can get the seat they pay for. lose the bet, pay extra. or go on another (overbooked) flight. or don\\'t go at all. do not ever fly american airlines. i won\\'t. if i can\\'t get where i want on another airline, i\\'ll drive.',\n",

       " \"indianapolis to chicago via milwaukee. the ind - ord was delayed. keep in mind that the pandemic's still raging across the usa. some many factor's could be in play. nothing was said for several minutes once pushed back from the ind gate. the cockpit crew had waited and finally had stated the delay reasons and that they were working on it. perhaps and according to them, they were coordinating the atc delay with their company. i understand this being a 44 years veteran airline pilot myself. keep in mind that i'm traveling on a regular paid for ticket like any other public person would. however, they could of said something sooner as we had sat for many minutes. the one thing i can not ever understand is once en-route, i asked the first class cabin flight attendant about my very tight connection at chicago's ord airport. i knew from several years ago that many times that the cockpit crew could radio or acars (aircraft radio and address system) a message ahead and alert the company about inbound passenger's with their tighter flight connections. so, then sometimes the airline would consider holding their connecting flights depending on the number of passengers connecting to and what flights. this would especially be essential if it were the only outbound international flight leg journey that person was connecting to. so, this f/a had just replied that he had no idea what they would do, even when i had later mentioned about my connection i was trying to make. yes that f/a probably had felt that he had better address my inquiry and not just shun me off. like he was initially trying to do by not really showing any level of good responsible care. so, all he really would confirm was the arrival gate and departure gate of the next connecting flight i had. and, that he had no prior experience of the gate nor it's walking time, etc. how thoughtless i felt. the handling of this was so poor. the long and short was this. i barely made my flight connection to mke from ord after a 10 mins. walk from terminal h5 to g16. through no help of any aa employee or on board means. the rest of my review is that during this covid19 crisis, do not expect any level of first class service other than a nicer, roomier seat. no food and no water nor any beverages. only if the domestic flight is over something like 2,500 mi. per flight segment. and some time limit. all of the airlines are losing massive amounts of daily money. the u.s. government has been offering assistance though. it will be a longer road than most realize for them to bounce back. this will also decimate any decent level of airline employee service as moral is markedly down. furloughs and major job losses loom on the horizon. unfortunately, the airline's service levels suffer. the international flights and service is somewhat better since those ticket prices are very high due to fewer flights (i.e. supply and demand). hopefully things will eventually get better within a year or two from 2020. with more demand for traveling. people are scared.\",\n",
